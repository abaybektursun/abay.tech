            Summer, 2022. I quit my lucrative AI job not out of dissatisfaction, but out of <em className="text-purple-700 font-medium">exhilaration</em>. My past couple of years were brimming with happiness, which sparked an awakening within me: if I did not leap into the unknown, doing so might eventually become difficult or even impossible. Within two hours of this epiphany, I sent my company 2-week notice.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Prior to my return to AI, I filled various roles - a mover, a
          photographer, a dating coach. While they were entertaining diversions,
          AI remained my true love, leading me to freelance and consult in the
          space. <span style={{ fontWeight: 400 }}>
            Despite exploring a variety of avenues, it was Upwork that stood out
          </span>
          , it consistently delivered quality clients and became the major
          source of my income. It allowed me to travel around South America and
          have incredible adventures. One day, I was jogging in Medellin, and I
          realized without a shadow of a doubt that I am ready to build a
          startup. I started reading books, building prototypes, and talking to
          a lot of people in entrepreneurship and tech. One theme kept coming
          up, and Naval Ravikant put it succinctly:{' '}
          <em>
            "You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet
            know how to get. At scale."
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I started looking for problems to be solved. Then, I remembered that
          there is a vast pool of real-life business problems I have been
          sitting on: Upwork. If a business does not have the capacity to solve
          a problem internally, they look for help externally. Unlike something
          like surveys, client will post their problem only if they are truly in
          need of a solution. Upwork is a goldmine of business opportunities,
          you just need little help form AI to extract them.

    You are a product-market-fit expert that follows the 80/20 rule, has an engineering mindset, and understands customer problems very deeply. Give non-BS, non-corporate response. 
    Return a list of tags that apply to the job posting. Chose the tags that apply to the job post from below:
    * Talent: If the post is describing the skills, experiences, or any other attributes they are looking for, or describes the responsibilities/requirements for the talent, they will go to this field.
    * Client: if the post talks about the poster (client). Could be a company, org, or individual, put that information in this field.
    * Problem: If the post describes a specific pain point or problem the customer has that talent can address, explain it here. This is an important field. Problem is something to be solved by the talent, so "looking for" / "seeking" must NOT be in this field. Again, the problem is not finding talent or hiring, but a problem to be solved by the talent. Do not include "looking to hire", "needs to hire" etc. in this field, just the client's problem to be solved by someone they would hire.
    * Implied Problem: If the post does not explicitly specify the problem, you can imply the problem,  this might be some more deep-rooted problem that was not mentioned in the post. Seeking talent is not a Problem. 
    * Client Solution: If the client already knows the solution, explain it here. Again, the solution is not finding talent or hiring, but a solution to be implemented by the talent.
    * Outcome: What's the business outcome if the problem and implied problems are solved?

    Respond in JSON format, for example:
    \`\`\`
    {{ "Talent": "...", "Client": "...", Problem:"...", "Implied Problem": "..." }}
    \`\`\`
    Only add keys if the attribute applies. The values are strings with your explanation and reasoning for the chosen attribute, so the entire response is in JSON format. Only respond with the JSON.
