I crave to share and create meaningful connections with people who resonate with living aligned and fulfilling life.

### New Found Love

My baby gal recently discovered a phenomenal triathlon coaching group called NVDM, which inspired me to finally learn how to swim. In just under a month, I’ve gone from being completely unable to swim freestyle to knocking out 2,000 yards in a single session—soaring past my 500-meter and 1 km goalposts. I used to dread swimming and felt I had no talent for it, but now I’m head over heels and can’t wait for those 6 a.m. classes.

Even sweeter, NVDM’s membership includes free access to Lifetime Fitness—and it’s cheaper than a standard gym subscription. Hopefully, they won’t “patch” this perk anytime soon, cause the spa is outstanding.

### Routine

I’ve been very much into healthmaxxing. Where attention goes, energy flows. Doing the right things for my body is working. More often I find myself “2 inches off the ground”: I feel elevated, light, sharp, in a great state overall. 

I am abusing my ChatGPT Pro plan by using deep research functionality for optimizing all aspects of my health. I have been collecting all the data possible about my body and passing it to ChatGPT Deep Research to optimize. Blood tests, DNA analysis, scans, hormone panel, Apple health data. 
Three things health optimizations that I find useful and feel in day to day life:

1. Testosterone. I am realizing that one of the biggest leverages for man’s quality of life is elevated levels of testosterone. Other than lifting and healthy lifestyle, I found that these supplements almost immediately elevate my testosterone: 
    1. Turkesterone: plant is indigenous to the Pamir-Alay mountain ranges, next to my home country!
    2. KSM-66: full-spectrum ashwagandha root extract, known for its high concentration and potency
    3. Tongat Ali: traditional herbal medicine native to Southeast Asian countries
2. Genetic methylation report: tells you how your body processes nutrient, useful knowledge to know for maintaining high levels of energy. When I read my report, it felt on point: I cannot eat too much protein in one sitting, I get energy from fasting and and dark greens, I benefit tremendously from creatine supplementation (the heterozygous MTHFR C677T variant, roughly 40% reduction in enzyme activity). I recommend doing specialized testing but I just exported my `23 and Me` DNA sequence data and sent it to 3rd party service: Xcode Life. It showed me the highest leverage supplements and diet routines to follow which I have been finding accurate.
3. Immunity: I feel like I was at the edge of getting sick but not getting sick during high flu seasons. I suspect it’s due to all of the immunity support I use:
    1. Shilajit: resin found in mountain rocks in the Himalayas, I love to snack on this with Pu'er tea.
    2. Propolis: natural substance produced by honeybees.
    3. Astragalus root: traditional Chinese medicine, I love to brew tea out of it. It tastes earthy and slightly sweet.
    4. Host Defense MyCommunity: Blend Mushroom Supplement for Immune Support
    5. Good old garlic and ginseng.

Other things I have in my health routine:

- Doing ice baths and cryo therapy turn me “ON”, I am realizing that this is the most sought after state for me currently and allows me to transition to any other state I want: Flow, love, fun, introspective, social, etc.
- Hydrogen water: According to longevity expert Gary Brecka, top MMA fighter Job Jones began using hydrogen water to address persistent stiffness, soreness, pain he experienced after waking up each day and started seeing significant positive results.
- Eucalyptus Steam Room: wow, just magical.
- Morning face ice bath: easier to wake up + right and younger skin.
- Eating raw salt to to reduce tension in my head when I have them.
- Whoop: I just started to using it, many people I respect wear this device, so I am excited to see how it performs in the upcoming weeks.
- Pure NMN Powder: NAD+ supplementation.
- IV-Drip: I have been trying various vitamin drips.
- Red light therapy. According to science and anecdotal evidence it’s legit, and I have been noticing results using my face red light therapy device.

**Barefoot Snatching**

I have been doing Olympic lifting for almost three months now. I started by barely snatching the bar with professional lifting shoes to hitting my PR of 60kg barefoot just 3 days ago. People freak out every time they see me barefoot snatchin', saying that it's too risky, but for some reason, it feels right, feels liberating. I even made a bet with my coach: if one day I can snatch 100kg barefoot, he will gift me the equivalent of his left testicle.

My squat goal is 180kg. Currently, I can safely squat 140kg, and my estimated maximum is 150kg, which is 30kg+ more than when I started. My clean is 100kg with a goal of 120kg. Clean and jerk is 80kg with a goal of 100kg.

The gym I go to is Austin Barbell Club, and it has been amazing for motivation, support, and a sense of community.

### Career Coaching

I just started working with a career coach who used to be a leader at DeepMind - my dream AI lab. It's becoming clear that my self-doubt and past inability to think honestly about my aspirations held me back from acknowledging my true desires, preventing me from taking decisive action. My decade-long dream of joining one of the top AI labs hasn't faded; in fact, it burns stronger than ever. Now is the time to pursue this path wholeheartedly.

I might fail, and that will certainly hurt, but I'll find more peace knowing I tried rather than carrying the weight of karma of desire. AI consulting has been incredibly rewarding - teaching me about psychology, collaboration, business dynamics, and state-of-the-art AI models while allowing me to travel the world full time. However, the moment has arrived to chase my long-term dreams. My ultimate career goal is to establish a successful startup that creates magical open-source AI models that push the boundaries of what's possible.

### AI Community

I've been planning to host an AI community gathering in Austin. After discussions with friends, this idea has evolved into something more ambitious: Sol Hills Collective: https://solhills.co/

My vision for this community is to:

1. Introduce a conscious, modern, and healthy lifestyle approach to people working in traditionally rigid, ego-driven business and tech environments.
2. Foster an authentic community where members can discover optimistic and mindful approaches to building AI technology.
3. Facilitate meaningful connections—friendships, potential co-founder relationships, and new opportunities—for myself and all participants.
4. Generate excitement and momentum around Austin's AI builders and innovators.

### My Baby’s Tea Community

My sweet pea has been courageously pursuing her dreams lately. After struggling with shyness and introversion for most of her life, she's recently begun to emerge from her shell in remarkable ways. She's has been hosting beautiful, donation-based tea socials. She formed connections with an impressive array of people—talented artists, innovative entrepreneurs, spiritual practitioners, and athletes. 

Being able to support her throughout this transformative journey fills me with profound joy and gives me a deep sense of meaningful contribution to her growth.

### Pull to God

Most mornings and evenings, I immerse myself in meditation, finding delight in presence and devotion. I've created a small puja corner in my apartment—a sacred space where I sit, chant, perform traditional tea ceremonies, read holy texts, and meditate. I'm discovering that meditation practice shouldn't be enforced but rather cultivated through allowing, curiosity, genuineness, and stillness. After experiencing the sweet nectar of presence, I see no path back to my former way of being.

Recently, I've been reading **Miracle of Love: Stories about Neem Karoli Baba**. Simply sitting with this book—slowly absorbing its words or even just gazing at it—feels profoundly beautiful. The book shares stories of Maharaj-ji (known in the West as Neem Karoli Baba) as told by his devotees. He was the Guru of my beloved Ram Dass. Even experiencing him secondhand—or perhaps thirdhand—through these pages, I can feel the powerful pull toward love and God. Here's a particularly delicious passage from the book:

> **Many Levels—Many Changes**
When you finally arrived at the right place at the right time and were told, "Yes, he's here," and found yourself seated before him, what was it like? Even the tongues and hands of the gods and goddesses of speech, music, and poetry could not do justice to those occasions. So how could I? Like the blind men with the elephant, each devotee met a different Maharaji. When Maharaji came out you never knew what to expect. He could do the same thing a week in a row until you'd think, "Well, he'll come out at 8:00." Then he might not come out all day, or he might just go into another room and close the door and be in there for two days. You had to learn to expect the unexpected. One day he came out and all he said all day long was "Thul-Thul, Nan-Nan," repeating these words to himself like a mantra. Days went by like this and somebody finally said, "Maharaji, what are you saying?" And it turned out to be an old Behari dialect and all it meant was "Too big, too big, too little, too little." When he was finally asked why he was saying this, he said, "Oh, all you people, you all live in Thul-Thul, Nan-Nan; you live in the world of judgement. It's always too big or too little."

### Hairy judgment

Last week, my hair desperately needed some grooming, so I found one by searching for “*trusted men’s hair stylists that specialize in medium to long hair*” using Perplexity (AI powered search engine). My baby, Mandy had dropped me off at the hair dresser’s location. I saw some rundown houses, what my mind interpreted to be a disadvantaged community. One of the houses had a sign “haircuts by appointments only”. Since I have booked the appointment while ago, I thought I was expected. So I entered the door only to be greeted by two large angry guard dogs that chased me out. The neighbors came over to check the commotion. Mind’s immediate judgment was “crackheads, soft white underbelly of America”, I looked around and judged the condition these people were living in: broken vases, dirt, and trash. The thought came: “these people can’t take care of their house, how can I trust them to hold sharp objects around my head?”. I decided to leave and called Mandy, however before I finish, a woman drifted into the front porch in a scooter, on which she was carrying another scooter! She was the hair stylist, and my mind judged her to be a young and beautiful, and all of a sudden, the negative judgments took a backseat! Ha! This funny interplay of judgment of appearances made me chuckle. Here I thought I was getting enlightened, yet my mind lives in such superficial level. Her energy and attitude were great, and her passion and knowledge for hair made me feel like I’ve met someone I have been looking for my entire life. It was kind of true, I have paid hundreds of dollars for a single cut to find an expert, but was never satisfied with them. We were having a lively chat and she shared with me that she has been struggling with Aspergers her entire life. Suddenly, I remembered my struggles when I was younger: not being able to keep up routines like other “normal” people, struggling socially and academically, being obsessive. 

Judgment - separates, compassion - unties. Suffering is the most potent fuel for compassion.
