Abay liked to think of himself as the kind of man who could take the heat. Not in a metaphoric sense — he’d cry at Finding Nemo — but in a literal sense. He once put an entire ghost pepper in his mouth on a dare and spent three hours on the bathroom floor, calling it “a religious experience.” Mandy, his girlfriend, was the opposite. Spice wasn’t her thing; she called a regular pepperoni pizza “a bit fiery.”

So when Abay took her to a hotpot restaurant for the first time, he figured he’d be safe, with her taste buds so virginal that even a jalapeño would be a “haban-no.” But Abay, like so many bold men before him, underestimated the power of the double-dip broth.

They were seated at a table with a bubbling cauldron divided down the middle. One side was “mild,” a red swamp of spices and what Abay thought could be boiled demons, while the other side was a pale broth he figured was “for the weak.” Mandy looked at it skeptically, then turned to him, her gaze betraying a hint of challenge.

“Is that the spicy side?” she asked, eyeing the bubbling red lava.

“Yeah, but don’t worry. The mild side’s still good,” he said, popping a piece of beef into the inferno. He tried to look relaxed, though his tongue was already planning its escape.

“Let’s try the spicy one,” she said.

Abay’s mind did a mental record scratch. “Wait, you want the spicy side?”

She shrugged. “It’s just soup, right?”

Now, anyone who knows Abay knows he would never pass up a chance to look cool — especially not in front of Mandy. So, with an inner sigh, he went along. He grabbed a handful of the baby corn, dunked it into the red broth, and popped it into his mouth. He instantly felt his ancestors turn in their graves.

Mandy, watching, picked up a piece of tofu from the spicy side and took a nibble. Then, to his horror, she grabbed a whole mouthful of spicy broth-soaked veggies, slurping it down as if she were sipping chamomile tea.

“This… this is amazing!” Mandy said, her face barely red. “I didn’t know spicy could taste this good.”

Abay was sweating, his vision blurring as he tried to keep a smile on his face. "Yeah... spicy. Great."

An hour later, as they staggered home, Mandy was still buzzing. “We have to do that again!” she said, beaming as if she hadn’t just tasted the heat of the sun.

Abay, meanwhile, was preoccupied with a single, haunting thought. “If Mandy calls the pizza fiery and she can handle this, maybe I’m the mild side…”
