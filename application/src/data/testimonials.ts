He has a cool personality and I feel like I learn about both machine learning and life simultaneously while working with him which I appreciate. Abay embodies the \"think different\" mentality. He has great agency and has done an exceptional job both planning and implementing our machine learning project from start to finish. It\'s a challenging problem, but he\'s up for the challenge. Computer vision / machine learning is at the core of our product, and it was a significant task for anyone to take on. I trust him a great deal, which speaks for itself. I\'m excited to continue working together!',
